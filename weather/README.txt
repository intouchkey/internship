Additional information: I copied the function from this website, the reason i decided to serach up on the internet because there is already a module for this particular function(converting xml to json) so I think it's unnecessary for us to make our own function for this question

How to compile/build/run the program?
Answer: You need to run this file with python 3.7 (IDLE) (with pip install json and xmltodict)
